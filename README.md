## Getting and Cleaning Data  Project

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Overview

This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis.
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The source data for this project can be found here.http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

### Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### Files

The code takes all the required data in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps and it can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The .txt file contains the data about second independent dataset  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject ,
and uploaded to the  course project's form.


Additional Information:

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
